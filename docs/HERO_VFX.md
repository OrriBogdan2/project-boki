# Hero VFX and sounds

A Hero's ability looks and sounds are data: `content/vfx/<arch>.json`, played by the shared `HeroVfx`
(`scripts/match/hero_vfx.gd`, one pooled node per match). A Hero needs a data file, a line per
moment in its kit, and sounds. Check: `--hero-vfx-check` (every data file against its kit, plus the shared runtime). Tuning a
palette: `--hero-vfx-gallery --shots-dir=<dir> [--reel-hero=<arch>]` plays every move side by side (no Hero: one of every
layer kind). Approval sheets and the reel: `--hero-vfx-reel` (the tool's header has the movie-writer command); a Hero's
scripted parts go in `tools/vfx_reel/<arch>.gd`, otherwise the generic set plays.

## From a kit
- `vfx("move", at, dir, {...})` (ArchKit): a moment. Sounds and layers come from the recipe; online it goes to other
  games as the `["fx", "hvfx", ...]` event, since they don't run the kit. Set `"net": false` on a recipe to keep it local.
- `HeroVfx.of(m).hold(h, "move", k)`: something that lasts while the kit asks every tick (a blade heating). It follows its
  anchors and turns with the aim (a hose sweeping), and stops by itself when the asks stop, whichever way the move
  ended. Particle layers only, and local. Passing `"at"` in `extra` each tick moves it (a zone following a hammer).
- `HeroVfx.of(m).shell(h, "move")`: a lasting surface the kit shows, hides and places itself (the move's first layer, a
  `skirt` or a `dome`; one per hunter, not pooled). Kael's guard shell, Albert's aegis.
- `HeroVfx.pal(arch, "key")`: a palette colour for the kit's own telegraphs and areas (AimKit lanes, rings), so they
  match its looks.
- `HeroVfx.of(m).trail(h, "move", node)`: the move's `ribbon` layers follow a projectile's node (a shot's mesh) until it
  is hidden or freed, at most `TRAIL_MAX` s. For tracers, needles, thrown charges. A pooled skin
  (`KitLooks.skin(shot, kind)`, which returns the skin node) is followed the same way; its return to the pool hides it.
- `run_own(stage, cx)` (ArchKit) in place of `run`: the stage's rules run, the shared cast language (AbilityFx, KinExec's rings,
  cones and delivery sounds) stays out, so only the Hero's own look shows.

## A recipe
`"move": {"sfx": [...], "fx": [...]}`. Options the kit passes (`"r"`, `"len"`, `"w"`, `"k"` the charge, `"flip"`, or any flag
named by a layer's `"when"` / `"unless"`) fill sizes: `"size": "r"` with `"size_x"` to scale it, `"size_k"` to grow with `k`.

| layer `p` | what | key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `sweep` | an arc of flame, burning away | `size`, `arc` deg, `tilt`, `yaw`, `flip` |
| `scorch` | the ground burning, fissures cooling; with `"stitch": true` a lane is a seam of cross-stitches | `shape` disc / lane / cone, `size` or `len` + `w`, `arc` |
| `skirt` | a wall of flame growing out | `size`, `from`, `tall`, `arc` (share of the circle) |
| `flare` | a ragged burst facing the camera | `size`, `grow` |
| `ribbon` | a mesh trail following an anchor, or the kit's `o.follow` node with `"follow": true` | `at`, `life`, `tail` s, `size` width, `wave` m of sideways drift (a thread) |
| `thread` | a loose thread lying on the ground from `at` along `dir`, swaying | `len`, `w`, `life` (may outlast the 2.2 s cap, with its needle) |
| `string` | holds only: a thin glowing line through named anchors | `through`, `size`, `skip_if` (a model node that means it brings its own) |
| `chain` | holds only: a chain of links from `at` to the kit's `to` (passed on every ask); the hold's `k` is its tension: 0 hangs slack and sways, 1 pulls straight and glows, with glints running toward the hand | `size` width, `link` m per link, `slack` m of sway |
| `bolt` | a strip from A to B facing the camera: lightning with `jag` > 0 (0.3-0.7), a taut thread at 0 | `size` width, `len` along the aim, or `to` (an anchor), or `rise` m straight up (negative with `y`: a strike from the sky), or the kit's `o.to` (a Vector3; local only, other games use `len`) |
| `vortex` | a ground disc spinning inward to a dark core (`c3`) | `size` radius, `spin` turns/s (negative: the other way), `grow` |
| `dome` | a clear curved shield pane: a rim halo, a sheen where it turns from the eye, faint plates that crack dark with `life` (its wear), `shine` lights it | `size` radius, `arc` deg (centred ahead) |
| `ember` / `smoke` / `chunk` / `shard` / `card` / `coin` / `star` / `drop` | GPU particles: hot streaks, puffs, dark debris, crisp crystals, tumbling cards burning from the edges, spinning metal glints, twinkling four-point stars, water drops | `n`, `speed`, `spread`, `way` up / fwd / back / along, `grav`, `drag`, `curl`, `shape` ball / line / disc / gather / arc, `burst` 1 all at once .. 0 over the life |

All layers: `at` (`here`, `h` the body, or an anchor), `y`, `fwd`, `delay`, `life`, `c` / `c2` / `c3` (palette keys: body,
hot, char), `near` (dropped past LOD_NEAR). Sounds: `n`, `db`, `other` (extra dB for anyone but the player), `pitch`,
`pitch_k`, `var`, `delay`, `at`, `when` / `unless`.

## FX anchors
`"anchors"` in the data names points on the Hero. Each resolves in order: `nodes` (empties on the .glb, e.g.
`anchor_blade_tip`, or `weapon_muzzle`), `bone` (a contract bone such as `hand.R`, `forearm.L`, `head`, with `off` [x, y, z] in the bone's space: follows the live pose on any .glb model), `gun` (a point in the Gun node's space), `body` ([side, up, forward] from the feet along
the aim), with `hand` r / l between them for a point that rides a hand bone. So a look works on today's model and picks the new anchors up when a model ships them. `docs/RIG_STANDARD.md` lists
the empties; Kael reads `anchor_blade_tip`, `anchor_blade_mid`, `anchor_chain_hand`, `anchor_feet` when present, Lace
`anchor_nock`, `anchor_bow_root`, `weapon_muzzle`, `halo_bow_top`, `halo_bow_low`.

## Rules
- **Colour:** looks stay in the Hero's palette. The you / ally / enemy language is the telegraphs' and outlines' job: lanes
  and discs are AimKit's and are not drawn here. An ally's effects draw at `ALLY_K`.
- **Budget:** `MAX_LIVE` GPU particles alive in a match, `POOL` nodes per kind, the quality preset's `fx` thins particles,
  past `LOD_NEAR` the `near` layers drop and particles halve, past `LOD_FAR` nothing draws. No per-ability lights. Looks
  last at most 2.2 s, flares at most 4 m, swirls at most 4.5 m (checked).
- **Ground:** each emitter knows the ground under it (`_seat`, `World.ground_at`). A falling particle lands and skids
  instead of sinking, and every particle fades out over its last 0.15 m above the ground (a soft particle by height, so
  it works on gl_compatibility too). The ground is the one under the emitter, so a spark that flies off a terrace edge
  lands on the upper terrace's height.
- **Status marks are shared, not a kit's:** a stun shows `StunMark` (`scripts/match/stun_mark.gd`: a spiral and three
  stars over the head, in the plate's STUNNED yellow) on any stunned Hunter or monster for as long as `stun_t` lasts, from
  a fixed pool of 8; a kit draws no stun look of its own (checked in `--hero-vfx-check`, with every Hunter's dash drawing
  its own look rather than the shared team-colour pill).
- **No stall on first cast:** `prewarm(at)` (called from `Match.warm_up`) holds up one node of every kind, particles
  running, so their shaders compile with the match's other stand-ins. A new layer kind must be added to `POOL`.
- **Sound:** everything is a one-shot through `Sfx.play`, so nothing can outlive a match. The sound files and their loudness
  standard are docs/AUDIO.md's (content/sfx/<arch>.json); a recipe only says which to play and how loud.
