# Time to knock against the source

PARITY FIRST (briefs/DECISIONS.md 2026-11-07). `godot --headless --path . -- --ttk-check` fights each Hunter against an idle standard target in a live match and works the same fight out for the source Hunter from `supervive_kits.md` (briefs/supervive-data on origin/ext/agent-briefs). `--ttk-check --write` rewrites the tables below. The check exits 1 while any row is out of the bar without an override (18 of 38 rows today); that is the finding, not a flake. Only Motley is tuned (below); the other outliers are listed with their causes as suggestions.

**Method**
- Target: full health and full armour. Ours 154 health (mean of the 12), armour 339 (x2.2) and the game's 20% reduction. Source 1285 Base HP (mean of the 12, supervive_physics.md) and Common armour, 20% reduction (docs/SUPERVIVE_DATA.md section 3). Both armours outlast the health, so only the 20% counts. Void, Oath and Shiv tooltips were read at level 15, so their source target is the level 15 mean (1285 + 14 x 77.1).
- (a) LMB only, held (taps for Kael and Albert, a 1.1 s draw for Lace). (b) Combo: every direct-damage non-ult ability the source has a number for, cast once at the start and again whenever its cooldown or charge is back, LMB between. Conditional bonuses (Dazed, Static, Ignite, Quickflip's empowered shot, sweet spots, stacks) are left out of the source side; ours runs live, so its passives count.
- Rank 0 is the unspent rank (slot_lv 1); max is rank 3 for ours and every listed upgrade for the source (a "x2" upgrade counts for both tiers it covers, charges included). LMB has no ranks, so (a) is the same at both.
- Source shots land at 0.00 s and every interval after; ours includes wind-ups, flight time and recoveries.
- Bar: ours / source time to knock inside 0.8 to 1.25. Below 1 means ours knocks faster. An outlier passes only with an owner override from DECISIONS in `OVERRIDES`, which names the damage share the owner gave up; a row then passes as override up to 1.25 / (1 - share). One today: Motley, DECISIONS 2026-11-06 (item 117, briefs/archive/OWNER_REVIEW_1103-2026-11-06.md) "loses ~15% held-fire DPS, no compensation buff", so up to 1.47.

**Gaps in the source data.** `supervive_kits.md` has no LMB damage for Lace, Meeko, Tenzo, Grimble and Neve, so those five have no source row (n/a, ours only). Neve's, Meeko's, Tenzo's, Grimble's and Lace's abilities do have some numbers but no LMB to fill the time between them, so no combo row either.

**Outliers and causes (suggestions, nothing built)**

| Hunter | Rows | Cause | Suggestion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vex (Ghost) | LMB 3.25x slow; combo max 0.78 | Per round the shares match (6 of 154 = 3.9%, 51 of 1285 = 4.0%), but ours fires every 0.12 s (wiki and weapon sheet say 0.08 s; our 5 fps footage says about 0.14 s) and `sustain_loss` 0.5 halves every round after the tenth, where the source's first 10 rounds are the extra ones and rounds 11 to 30 stay at base. Our grenade matches (1.11x), the E beam is 1.49x. | Drop `sustain_loss` so rounds 11+ keep full damage and the first 10 get a bonus; settle 0.08 vs 0.12 s from footage first. |
| Kael (Brall) | LMB 0.65; combo 0.45 and 0.16 | Slash 8 is 5.2% of our target against 43 = 3.3% (1.56x, cadence 0.34 vs 0.35 s matches). Rampage hits 9 + tip 18 = 17.5% of the target against Flame Step 49 = 3.8% (4.6x); Warchain 5.2% vs 2.3% (2.2x); Smash 16.9% vs 10.1% (1.67x). Max rank adds +40% Smash and a shorter dash recharge on top. | Slash 8 -> 5, Rampage hit 9 / tip 18 -> about 2 / 4 (the tip doubling is ours), Warchain hit 8 -> 3.6, Smash 26 -> 15. |
| Cinder (Felix) | LMB 0.78, 0.76; combo 0.76, 0.61 | Stream 25.6% of the target a second vs 20.1% (258 of 1285). Cinder Shot 13.1% vs 8.2% (1.59x); the dash 0.70x and the cloak 0.76x are under. | Stream damage x0.8; Cinder Shot 20 -> 13; dash x1.4, cloak x1.3. |
| Sparkle (Joule) | LMB 0.77; combo max 0.64 | Bolt 12 every 0.648 s is 12.0% a second against 90 every 0.8 s = 8.8% (1.37x); the owner set 0.648 s (items 70 and 116 in docs/heroes/mage.md, not in DECISIONS). Abilities are at parity (1.03 to 1.13x), so max rank (+90% spear, +100% dash, +50% strike on the source side vs our +15% and +30% steps) is where the combo drifts. | Bolt 12 -> 9 keeps 0.648 s (owner) at parity; ask the owner whether item 116 covers the damage. |
| Albert (Oath) | LMB 0.73; combo 0.71, 0.73 | Hammer 12 is 7.8% against 192 of 2365 = 8.1% (match). Ours alternates throw and recall hits faster than 0.45 s (about 3.3 hits a second against 2.2); if the source recall hits as well, as the tooltip's "recall (192 dmg)" may mean, the source is 3.4 s and the ratio 1.45, still out. Spin Dash is at parity (1.01x). | Settle whether the source recall deals damage, then set throw_rate or recall_dmg. |
| Motley (Void) | was LMB 1.91; combo 2.15, 1.74; now 1.09; 1.13, 1.00 | Orb 9 was 5.8% of the target against 263 of 2365 = 11.1%; Snap and seed about half the source. | Done (ext/parity-ttk-motley): orb 9 -> 14.5 (the source's 17.1 share less the owner's ~15%, item 117), Snap 9.5 -> 18 and seed 12.5 -> 23.7 (source shares, hit 1.00x and 1.11x), seed burn 8.2 -> 16.2 (250 vs 365). The 0.6 s cadence, the charge to 1.4 s, the +34% full orb, Swollen +44% and the 3.5x peak are unchanged. |

Within the bar: Motley at both ranks (1.00 to 1.13), Sable at both ranks, Vex combo rank 0, Albert combo rank max (0.84). The Kael, Sparkle and Albert causes above predate main's later kit merges (the 2026-11-11 table moved Kael's combo to 0.55 and 0.59, Sparkle's to 0.17 and 0.20); re-read them before tuning.

**Not done here:** no tuning; the five Hunters with no LMB number (and their combos) need the source's LMB damage, which no file in briefs has.
