# Audio: sound sets, loudness and buses

How the game's sound effects are made, named, levelled and played. Music and ambience are in `tools/compose.py` and `tools/gen_ambience.py`.

## Making sounds
- Sounds are **synthesised in code** (numpy/scipy, `pip install numpy scipy`), one script per group: `tools/gen_sfx_<group>.py` (e.g. `gen_sfx_vex.py`, `gen_sfx_boki.py`, `gen_sfx_ui.py`). Each one imports `tools/sfx_lib.py`, calls `S.reseed(<its own seed>)` and writes `audio/<name>.wav` (44.1 kHz mono 16-bit). Then `godot --headless --import`.
- `sfx_lib.py` re-uses the primitives in `tools/sfx_combat.py` (filters, envelopes, kick, click, crack, sub, tail, reflections, ring, grains) and adds `voice()` (wordless grunts and cries through vowel formants), `chime()`, `creak()`, `fm()`, `sweep()`, `rattle()`, `hiss()`.
- Outside sources only if **CC0**, logged in `docs/CREDITS.md` under the group's own section (source URL, author, licence, which file). No sounds from SUPERVIVE or any other game.
- Review: `python3 tools/sfx_look.py out.png audio/<names>*.wav` draws waveform + spectrogram + levels per sound (matplotlib). Use it to judge layering, clicks and harshness, and as the READY screenshot.
- Held sounds (a minigun spin, a charge hum): write them with `S.save_loop(name, x, cat)`, which cross-fades the tail into the head and skips the end fades, list them under `"loops"`, and play them with `Sfx.loop_start` / `loop_stop`.
- Variety: write takes with `S.takes_cat(name, fn, 3, cat)` (`name.wav` + `name_1..3.wav`); `Sfx` picks a different take each time.

## Loudness
Every sound is levelled to its **category** by `S.save_cat` / `S.takes_cat` (table: `content/rules/sfx_levels.json`): RMS over the audible part, peak ceiling -1 dBFS. The `vol_db` at the call site then only says intent (a quiet tell, a big ult), never fixes a file that is too loud.

| category | RMS dBFS | for |
|---|---|---|
| heavy_impact | -14.5 | a damage carry's hits (Vex, Kael, Grimble's blunderbuss, Mossy's hammer) |
| heavy_fire | -15.5 | a damage carry's weapon: a little louder than the lighter Hunters |
| impact | -16 | an ability or weapon landing |
| fire, signature | -17 | a shot or swing; a Hunter's recognisable sound |
| cast, grunt | -18 | an ability starting; hurt / downed / death voice |
| boki | -19 | Boki voices and moves |
| dash | -20 | |
| loop | -21 | held sounds |
| ui | -22 | menus and HUD |
| step | -23 | footsteps |

## Names
- A Hunter's own sounds start with its archetype id: `gunslinger_*` (Vex), `archer_*` (Lace), `juggernaut_*` (Kael), `bulwark_*` (Mossy), `ostra_*` (Motley), `ashwick_*` (Cinder), `dredge_*` (Grimble), `rimewright_*` (Neve), `tender_*` (Meeko), `thief_*` (Sable), `mage_*` (Sparkle), `dolm_*` (Tenzo). Older kit sounds keep their names (`vn_*`, `jug_*`, `rime_*`...); a branch that replaces one regenerates that file under its old name.
- **Shared kinds picked per Hunter by `HeroSfx`** (falls back to the shared sound when a Hunter has none): `<arch>_dash`, `<arch>_hurt`, `<arch>_down`, `<arch>_death`, `<arch>_step_grass|stone|wood|snow`, `<arch>_pickup`. Wired at: the dash (`Hunter`; with its own dash, `Feel.dash_sound`'s shared layers are skipped), footsteps (`Juice.footstep`), loot picked up or put on (`Pack`), your own hurt (`Match` damage), downed (`Match` knock and its net event) and death (`Life.drop_box`). The voice lines are wordless.
- Boki wisp sounds (`tools/gen_sfx_wisps.py`, wired in `KinSummon`, played positional so far ones get the far muffle): `wisp_chirp_small|medium|large` (the riding wisp every 14-26 s and as it blooms, pitched by body size and the individual's voice), `summon_burst_*` (wisp to Boki, on the burst), `summon_end_*` (the shrink back, when the fold starts) and `summon_killed_*` (knocked down: a faint sigh, the wisp leaving), each in small / medium / large by the body (`content/kin_v2` size), each with the species chirp layered in `KinSummon.cue`, all with `reach` 35 so a rival's summon is audible at 25 m (`--sfx-set-check` asserts it), `wisp_ready` (cooldown over). `wisp_grab` (a thief catches a loose wisp) is made but has no call site until the steal rule exists. The Hunter Wisp hum (`wisp_hum`) is `tools/gen_wisp_sfx.py` on ext/hunter-wisp-outline: round = low hum, critter = chirp.
- Boki sounds: `boki_*` (and the existing `kin_*` / `k_*` names); UI: `ui_*` (and the existing `click`, `hover`...).
- Species voices: `bk_<species>_<mood>` for every rigged species (`art/kin/*`), moods happy, alert, unsure, sleepy, hurt, 2 takes each (set `content/sfx/boki_voices.json`, made by `gen_sfx_boki.py`). Pitch comes from the species' weight, the texture from its type (crackle Fire/storm, burble Water/venom, rustle Grass/spore/swarm, chime Crystal/moon/sound, else plain), the 3-note motif is its signature. Play them with `KinVoice.cue(species, mood)`: it falls back to `kin_happy` / `kin_alert` / `kin_unsure` / `boki_sleep` / `kinhit` for a species with no set. A new species adds its row to `SPECIES_VOICE` and regenerates; `--sfx-set-check` fails if a rigged species lacks a mood.
- **Wisp proc chirp** (`KinWispProc`, `--wisp-proc-sfx-check`): when a carried Boki's on-shot passive (`carry.on_shot`) rides a shot while it is a wisp, `Hunter._kin_riders` makes one `KinVoice.cue(species, "happy")` chirp on the wisp (positional, so far ones muffle). Mix: yours **-20 dB**, a rival's **-26 dB** before distance, **-8 dB more** within 0.35 s of that hunter's own ability cast (`Hunter.cast_at`), so it never covers a kit sound (those sit at -6 to 0 dB). At most one per wisp per **0.8 s**. Pitch by body size: small x1.3, medium x1.0, large x0.78, times the Boki's own `Unique.voice`. A species with no voice set falls back to `kin_happy`.

## Sound sets (`content/sfx/<group>.json`)
```json
{"group": "gunslinger", "name": "Vex", "script": "tools/gen_sfx_vex.py",
 "sounds": {"gunslinger_dash": "dash", "gunslinger_hurt": "grunt", "vn_spin": "signature", "...": "..."},
 "signature": ["vn_spin", "gunslinger_grenade_thunk"],
 "kit_files": ["gunslinger_ult.gd"], "replaces": ["vn_rifle", "..."],
 "reach": {"gunslinger_fire": 45}, "loops": ["gunslinger_spin"]}
```
`--sfx-set-check` asserts: every listed sound has its file(s); every take is within 3 dB of its category and under the ceiling; a Hunter set has hurt/down/death, dash, steps on all four surfaces, a `fire` sound and its signature list; `HeroSfx` picks them up; every literal `m.sfx("...")` in that Hunter's kit (`<arch>_kit.gd` plus its `kit_files`) names a sound that exists. `replaces` lists old-name files the set regenerated. `reach` (metres, 22-80) makes a heavy sound carry past the usual 22 m, so you hear a carry coming (past 9 m it plays through the muffled bus, so the low end is what carries); `Sfx` reads it from every set at start. Each sound under `loops` must repeat seamlessly.

## Playing and buses
- Always through `Sfx.play(name, pos, vol_db)` / `m.sfx(...)` (one-shots, pooled, distance falloff, far sounds muffled) or `Sfx.loop_start(key, name, pos)` / `loop_set` / `loop_stop` (held sounds). Never a new `AudioStreamPlayer`.
- They play on the **SFX** bus (compressor, a little room, limiter; far ones via **SFXFar**). A match's sounds are torn down with the match (item 103, `Sfx.reset_scene_audio` stops keyed loops and pool voices on the match leaving the tree), so every held sound must be a keyed loop and stopped by its owner too.
- New sounds load on first play (`Sfx._lazy`, takes included); no edit to `Sfx.NAMES` is needed.

## Ultimate cast cues
You hear an ultimate before you see it. Every Hunter's X goes through `HeroUlt.press`, which calls `UltCue.cast`: the Hunter's own `<arch>_ult_cue` at its position plus a team tag, `ult_tag_ally` (bright, rising) for your team or `ult_tag_foe` (low, falling) for a rival, both at the same level (the colour tells them apart, never loudness). They carry 60 m (`reach` in `content/sfx/ult_cues.json`, falling off with distance, muffled past 9 m) and play on the match's pool voices. Kits only run in their owner's game, so the cast also sends `["fx", "ucast", nid]` and the other games play it. Sounds: `tools/gen_sfx_ult_cues.py` (own seed; re-rolls nothing else). `--sfx-set-check` asserts a cue and reach per Hunter with an ultimate; `--match-audio-check` the ally/rival tag and the range.
