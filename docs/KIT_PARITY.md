# Kit parity audit: 12 Hunters against the source (main 7907d9afe, 2026-11-07)

PARITY FIRST audit (briefs/DECISIONS.md 2026-11-07, briefs/PRIORITIES.md step 2). Read-only for the first audit; the ranges table below changed four numbers (data only).

**How to read a verdict.** `match`: same mechanic, within footage error. `differ`: built, not the same (says how). `missing`: not built. `differ (owner)`: an owner note overrides the source, so it stays unless the owner reverses it; not a gap. `ours`: not in the source at all.

**Evidence:** [D] game data (supervive_kits.md, supervive_physics.md), [F] footage (briefs/hero-ref), [O] owner note. Order of trust: O > D > wiki > F. Source references live only on `origin/ext/agent-briefs` (briefs/supervive-data, briefs/hero-ref, briefs/specs/kit-audit).

**What was and was not verified.**
- Numbers, modes and code paths were read from main. The Nov 3 audit (briefs/specs/kit-audit) is stale: many of its gaps are closed, and rows here were re-checked against main before use. `ext/online-displace` and `ext/no-shake` are merged, so the online pull bug and self-shake are closed.
- All 12 `--<hero>-combo-check` runs pass: 1,560 PASS, 0 FAIL. They assert our spec, not the source, so a pass is not parity proof.
- **Animation timing was not re-measured frame by frame.** Animation rows report clip coverage (computed from kit code, `warden_anim/*.json` and each GLB) plus timings already recorded in docs/heroes. Hitbox rows use content numbers; no in-game overlay run was done.
- `[?]` marks a row carried from a hero doc that I could not settle from code here.

**Every Hunter, shared:**
- **Q:** ours (a glove, gear slot, with V). Not in the source, so no parity target. DashFlow fires it through dashes.
- **Keys:** R = hunter ult (JSON slot `x`), X = Fuse, G = Boki (owner).
- **Run speed, ground accel, gravity, fall cap:** match [D]. **Stopping, air control, dash carry:** differ, see gaps 2 to 4.
- **Buffer:** `DashFlow.BUFFER_S` 0.15 s past a dash's end; the data gives no window.
- **Cooldowns below** read ours / source level 1 [D].

## Ranges and radii: RMB, E, R (main d255acbee, 2026-11-10)

Source = `briefs/supervive-data/supervive_kits.md` (the tooltips carry no range numbers, so only the Black Hole radius, 350/500 uu = 3.5/5.0 m, is data) plus the footage measures in `briefs/hero-ref` (1 body height = 1.8 m; a later per-ultimate re-measure wins over the first sheet). Ours = `content/archetypes/<id>.json`, metres. The aim indicator and the hit read the same JSON field for every row below; the Bola lane is drawn at the width the hit reaches (0.45 + body radius per side). **fixed** = changed here and asserted in `--kit-parity-check`. `[?]` = not measurable from the source, or an owner note stands.

Slice Wardens and LMB rank first (PRIORITIES step 2). Effort: S under a day, M a few days, L a week or more. `owner` = needs an owner call before building.

## Item 20: jump speed and the unsourced flow rows

**Jump speed.** Source: JumpZVelocity 750 uu/s = 7.5 m/s at gravity 14.7 m/s² (supervive_physics.md:45, [D]). Ours: `Hunter.JUMP_V` 6.8 m/s. Kept on purpose (`docs/MOVEMENT_FEEL.md`, "Jump 9 → 6.8"): 7.5 lets jump plus mantle top four terraces. It is a map-grammar deviation, not a source value; the owner can flip it once the terraces change. `--move-feel-check` now asserts `jump_speed_vs_source` (lift-off over 7.5, must sit in 0.85 to 1.0), so the source number is pinned and the gap cannot drift.

**Dash-flow rows with no `source` field `[?]`.** No source or footage settles these; they run as the kit's default (`keep`, or `fire` for Q). Not guessed.

| Hero | Rows `[?]` |
|---|---|
| Hem (`archer`) | `hold.lmb.{ground,air,jump}`, `hold.rmb.{ground,air,jump}` (6, `keep`); `dash.ground.q`, `dash.air.q` (2, `fire`; Q is ours, no source exists) |
| Ryzz (`mage`) | `hold.rmb.{ground,air,jump}` (3, `keep`); `dash.ground.q`, `dash.air.q` (2, `fire`, ours) |
| Tarek (`dolm`) | `hold.lmb.{ground,air,jump}`, `hold.rmb.{ground,air,jump}` (6, `keep`) |

Also still `[?]` and already marked "Not determinable" in their own `source`: Hem dash.ground.lmb, dash.air.{lmb,rmb,e,x}; Ryzz dash.{ground,air}.{lmb,rmb,e,x}. Other heroes carry further `keep` rows without a source (Cinder 3, Zedran 3, Bjorn 1, Claire 3, Pip 3, one each of Cinder and Grimble `dash.ground.lmb` "Not determinable"): same `[?]`.
