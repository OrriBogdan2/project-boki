# Hem (archer; shown as Ravyl): import note, v95 swap of Lace appeal3, body b (2026-11-10)

`hem.glb`: the owner's pick (11-10), Lace v95 r2 appeal3 `cand_b.glb` (the slimmer body; its face is the appeal3 face, one mesh), swapped
onto Hem's own skeleton, 48 clips and anchors by `tools/art1/v95_swap.py` (docs/art/wardens/V95_SWAP.md) with `art/wardens/src/hem_v95.json`.
Raw files in ~/meshy/v95/lace/r2/appeal3 (never in git); the spec reads `lace_v95_b_body.glb`, which is `cand_b.glb` without its
`lace_bow` node (cut from the glTF JSON, the buffer untouched): the game's bow and arrow (`bow_mesh`, `arrow_mesh`, on `bow*`/`arrow`)
stay as they were, with their weights.

    blender -b --factory-startup --python tools/art1/v95_swap.py -- art/wardens/src/hem_v95.json WORK art/wardens/hem/hem.glb

Body: 13k triangles (head 2.6k), one 2048 atlas embedded (Godot extracts it to `hem_atlas_1.jpg`; `hem_atlas.jpg` is the bow's).
Slots by colour and box (first match wins): metal (the back needles), hair, skin, cloth (red corset), leather (dark skirt, boots).
Weights: bone heat from the spec's joints; the back needles ride `hips`, the head box `head`, the left shoulder mask `pauldron.L`.

Lost from the scripted build (tools/art1/hem_pieces.py, hem_finish.py: that build is replaced, not merged):
the modelled eyelids (blinks no longer show; `lid`/`brow` bones move nothing), the lit strings on her right hand (no glow slot),
the thread and smoke cards, and the closed bow hand (her hands are the master's, open; the bow sits in the left hand as before).
`cape`, `skirt` and the spring chains carry no weight, so the skirt follows the legs. tools/warden_glb_check.gd no longer
asks for the lids and strings.

Rig unchanged: `legs` 2.35, `neck` -0.05, `size` 0.922 in content/archetypes/archer.json.

Shots on the game rig (idle, run, draw, loose; front, 3/4, side, face): docs/shots/lace-appeal-b/. No tearing and no arm
through the chest; the bow passes through her open left hand.

walk and run b, l, r, fl, fr, bl, br (2026-11-11, ext/anim-dirloops-lace-kael): `blender -b --factory-startup --python tools/art1/hunter_dir_gait.py -- art/wardens/hem/hem.glb OUT.glb 1.18 3.72`,
then `python3 tools/art1/glb_add_clips.py art/wardens/hem/hem.glb OUT.glb walk_b,walk_l,walk_r,walk_fl,walk_fr,walk_bl,walk_br,run_b,run_l,run_r,run_fl,run_fr,run_bl,run_br`.
The speeds are the forward loops' `loco.foot_mps`, not the loco speeds: walk_f/run_f are the old clips and stay, so
the ring keeps `stride`/`foot_mps` and the game's rate and stride lift every direction to loco speed the way they lift
forward. The blind Fable judge kept the old walk_r, run_l (tie or loss), so those are
the old clips put back with `glb_add_clips.py` (judge: docs/art/wardens/dirloops/JUDGE.md).
