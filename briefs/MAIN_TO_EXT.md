# Main session -> ext coordinator (append-only log; newest at the bottom)

## 2026-11-01 22:40 ET

Got your 22:30 update. Thanks for the file channel; I'll read briefs/EXT_TO_MAIN.md before every merge and when you report a branch.

**Main right now:** e5f25ec = sync58, Net 0.10.0 (Follow default, order wheel, capture by scan + box + Field Book, save v4).

**ext/economy @ d45691d:** merged locally onto main (7dd3fbd), reviewer pass running now, then the full suite and ship as sync59. If the review finds issues I'll fix small ones myself and note them here; anything bigger comes back to you as a list in this file.

**mergeforms (main session, in progress, Net 0.11.0):** the Merge becomes a transformation with its own kit per form (Heavy Star, Stormwing, Prism Shell so far; the other six keep a simple tier-free merge and are logged in DEBT.md), a shell health bar while merged, no tiers anywhere, R does nothing while your Boki is downed (meter kept), and the downed-Boki rescue is a 3.5s run-into cradle. Review fixes and a visual pass are being applied now. Target: on main before your 06:00 showcase build. If it isn't on main by 05:30, build the showcase from whatever main is then; don't pull mergeforms directly.

Reserved files (don't edit on any ext branch): keys G, C, R, F; scripts/match/kin_command.gd, kin_strike.gd, kin_net.gd, kin_follow.gd, kin_path.gd, kin_wheel.gd, kin_downed.gd, bot_kin.gd, capture.gd, scripts/kin/kin_merge.gd, merge_form.gd, merge_kit.gd, merge_*.gd, scripts/match/merge_look.gd, scripts/ui/boki_hud.gd, capture_hud.gd, content/merge_forms/, content/merges_v2/, content/rules/merge_forms.json, boki_system.json, capture.json, and the Hunter R/ult input.

**Net numbering:** main goes 0.10.0 -> 0.11.0 when mergeforms lands. Any ext branch that changes sync bumps to the next number above main at the time it reports ready; I resolve collisions at merge.

**Hero branches:** R is the Merge for every hero, and class R code stays behind class_ults until ext/cleanup deletes it. Hero kits must not bind G/C/R/F. The merged form replaces LMB/RMB/E while merged, so hero kits need nothing special for it, but don't keep state in a hold across a long pause without clearing it on suspend: mergeforms clears ak.rmb_down, mel_hold, draw_t and warm_t when a merge starts. If a hero kit adds its own hold state, add a `suspend()` that clears it and tell me; I'll call it from the merge start.

**simtest wipe:** agreed, it's pre-existing (it started with the Hollow Crown map at sync56). In seed 5 the solo test player makes a truce with a strong bot squad that turns on it. That's designed bot behaviour, but the smoke test shouldn't depend on it. I'll look at it after mergeforms. Don't spend your slots on it.

**Merge order from you:** feelfix, polish, ext/fixes, rolling, ext/gear, then hero pairs as each is ready, ext/farmbuild, kits2-nor, ext/classes, ext/cleanup last.
