# Inbox for the server coordinator (newest at the bottom)

Set up the status channel in SERVER_UPDATE4.md and push STATUS.md now. Then continue SERVER_UPDATE3. When you assemble ext/hero-shots, include for every hero: the kit card, each ability, the payoff, one animation frame strip, and one full-body portrait of the hero standing in neutral pose, so the owner can review the original character designs.

Owner granted standing permission to keep every slot busy (goal: maximum speed; weekly usage is low at ~22%). Changes:
1. Raise your cap to 4 sub-agents at once (sonnet).
2. Start `ext/farmbuild` now in the 4th slot, from current origin/main. Spec: section 4 of `git show origin/ext/main-overflow:docs/HANDOFF_main_overflow.md` (farm building pass: unlocks, build mode, Boki-built construction). Follow BRIEF_COMMON, BRIEF_UPDATE4 (reserved Boki files, Net rule: next above main at report time), AGENTS.md and docs/GAMEDEV_CHECKLIST.md; big files stay wiring-only (health.py --strict); add a --farmbuild-check; screenshots go in ext/hero-shots under farmbuild/; full suite once at the end.
3. Queue after kits2-nor: `ext/classes` (section 3 of the same doc: class unlocks + the "class" rename). Start it only once the hero finish passes are pushed, because the rename touches every archetype file; base it on main merged with the finished hero branches if they've landed, otherwise note the expected conflicts.
4. Never idle: whenever a slot frees, check this inbox, then start the next queued item. If the queue is empty, write "queue empty" in STATUS.md.

Main is now sync59 (fcc3745, Net.VERSION 0.11.0): mergeforms landed (merge = transformation with per-form kits, R = form ult that separates you, shell health bar, 3.5s rescue cradle). Full notes from the main session: `git show origin/ext/agent-briefs:briefs/MAIN_TO_EXT.md` (read the whole file; it's the main session's log).
1. Every branch you report ready must merge fcc3745 or later first. The four "ready" hero branches (joule-ghost, elluna-celeste, kingpin-felix, tetra-void) need that re-merge, then re-run the suite. Net: branches with new sync events (elluna-celeste "carry", tetra-void "zone") take 0.12.0 and 0.12.1; branches with no new sync keep 0.11.0. Same rule for myth-oath, kits2-nor, farmbuild.
2. Reserved files grew: merge_kit.gd, every merge_*.gd, content/merge_forms/, boki_system.json, capture.json (plus the earlier list). Keep main's side in conflicts.
3. Hero kits with their own hold state (charge, aim, channel): don't keep it across a merge. List each such field per hero in STATUS.md under "Hold state for MergeKit.drop_class_holds"; the main session will extend that function. Channelled actions should use Capture.hunter_stop(h) for interrupts.
4. Raise your cap to 5 sub-agents. New item, start it now in the 5th slot: **ext/economy review fixes** on branch ext/economy (currently d45691d). The 13 items and check gaps are in MAIN_TO_EXT.md under "2026-11-01 23:05 ET: ext/economy review". Fix all three blockers and the should-fixes, add the listed checks to --economy-floor-check, merge fcc3745, full suite, push, report ready in STATUS.md (Net: keep 0.11.0 unless it syncs something new).
5. Owner questions you raised (Tamsin healing; Archer/Bulwark additions): I've passed them to the owner. Until he answers, keep the current design and don't block on it.
6. Merge order the main session wants: feelfix, polish, ext/fixes, rolling, ext/gear, hero pairs as each is ready, ext/farmbuild, kits2-nor, ext/classes, ext/cleanup last.

Item 4 of the 05:00 entry (ext/economy review fixes) has been taken by the local machine. Don't start it. Everything else in the 05:00 entry stands. When you resume, push STATUS.md first; it has been silent since 04:20 UTC.
